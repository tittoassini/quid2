An umbrella repository for projects related to Quid2, a general framework for the definition, sharing, preservation and transfer of data.

The sub projects are:
* [quid2-net](https://github.com/tittoassini/quid2-net)
  * API for quid2-net, a *simple*, *accurate* and *free* messaging service.
* [typed](https://github.com/tittoassini/typed)
  * Language independent, absolute types.
* [flat](https://github.com/tittoassini/flat)
  * Principled and efficient serialization.
* [model](https://github.com/tittoassini/model)
  * Derivation of data type models from Haskell data types.

At this time the only usable project is [quid2-net](https://github.com/tittoassini/quid2-net) so that's where you want to [teleport yourself](https://github.com/tittoassini/quid2-net).
